When we create REact Component, then component goes several stages or lifecycle method.

Four Phases:
- Mounting: When instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.
- Updating: When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or states.
- Unmounting: When a component is being removed from the DOM.
- Error Handling: When there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle or in the custructor of any child.


Mounting Phase lifecycle methods are:
- constructor(props)
- static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) - 
- render() - Pure function or method (Return updated JSX with state and props)
- componentDidMount() - call side effect (best place)
