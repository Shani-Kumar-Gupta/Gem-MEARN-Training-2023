1. In Class based component, state getting initialized in constructor.
2. State is used to maintain the component state which describe the UI.
3. Never ever update or alter state directly instead use this.setState({})
4. setState({}) is async that's why always state updates later on once all the statement gets executed.

5. In your application, if you want to execute certain statements once state is gets updated pass callback function as second parameter.
this.setState({}, () => {
  // statement to execute post state updated
})

6. incrementFive() {
    this.increment();
    this.increment();
    this.increment();
    this.increment();
    this.increment();
  }

  React, batches the multiple setState calls into a single update for better performance.

7. Whenever, wants to update the state based on previous state, we need to pass function as an argument to setState Method.
