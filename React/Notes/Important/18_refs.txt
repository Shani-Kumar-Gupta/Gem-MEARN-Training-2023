Refs is used to access DOM node directly from React.
Use cases-
1. Focus specific field bydefault
2. To get the input value

Steps to achive functionality using ref-
1. Create a refs
2. Attach the created refs to the element - and to do that we have ref attribute
3. Implement the functionality on inputRef - this.inputRef.current.focus()

* Forward Refs: Is a technique for automatically passing refs through a component to one of it's children.
