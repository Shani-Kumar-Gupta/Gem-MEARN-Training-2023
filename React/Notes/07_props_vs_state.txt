props vs. state-
1. props get passed to the component from parent component
   state is managed within the component

2. props received as functional parameter
   state is variable declaration in the functional body

3. props are immutable.
   state can be changed becuase it's managed within the component

4. props - functional component
   this.props - Class based component

   useState Hook - funtional component
   this.state - Class based component
